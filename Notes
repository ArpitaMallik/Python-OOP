✅What is a Class?
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It bundles data (attributes) and functions (methods) that work together.
✅__init__() Method:
This is a special method called a constructor.
It runs automatically when an object of the class is created.
✅Attributes (Data Members) like id, salary, and designation are initialized automatically when we create an object of the class using the constructor (__init__()).
✅Methods (Functions) like travel() must be called manually using the object name (sam.travel("Dhaka")).
✅Python is object-oriented because it’s designed to model real-world problems using classes and objects, making code more organized, reusable, and scalable.
✅A function is a block of reusable code that performs a task.
✅A method is a function that is defined inside a class.
